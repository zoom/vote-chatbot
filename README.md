## Local/Development Setup

To run the completed Chatbot locally, follow these steps,

1. In terminal:

   `$ git clone https://github.com/zoom/vote-chatbot.git`

   `$ cd vote-chatbot`

   `$ npm install`

   `$ touch .env`

2. Add this code to your `.env` file, replacing the `Required` text with your respective [**Development** Zoom Chatbot API credentials](https://marketplace.zoom.us/docs/guides/getting-started/app-types/create-chatbot-app#register).

   ```
   client_id=Required
   client_secret=Required
   verification_token=Required
   bot_jid=Required
   slash_command=Required
   ```

3. In terminal:

   `$ npm run start` or `$ nodemon` ([for live reload / file change detection](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon))

   `$ ngrok http 4000` ([ngrok turns localhost into live server](https://ngrok.com/) so slash commands and user actions can be sent to your app)

5. Open your ngrok https url in a browser, you should see this,

   `Welcome to the Vote Chatbot for Zoom!`

6. On your App Marketplace Dashboard, add your ngrok https url to your Whitelist URLs (App Credentials Page), **Development** Redirect URL for OAuth (App Credentials Page), and **Development** Bot Endpoint URL (Features Page). Make sure to match the path after your ngrok https url with the express routes in index.js.

   > In order to click the **Save** button on the Features page when adding a Slash Command and Development Bot Endpoint URL, you have to provide a Production Bot Endpoint URL. Feel free to use https://zoom.us as a placeholder.

   After that, your app is ready to be installed!

7. On your App Marketplace Dashboard, go to the **Local Test** page and click **Install**. After you click the **Authorize** button, you should be taken to your redirect url and see this,
